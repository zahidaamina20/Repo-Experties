# Git Demo

cd--> change directory
mkdir --> make directory
ls --> list all files

## Flow of Git

Write --> Add --> Commit

## Git Commands

Use < git init > command for initialization.

## Add
--> Use < git add <file-name>> is used to stage your changed files so they can be included in the next commit.
--> Another way if we have multiple files for adding then use short command <git add .> instead of writing the namwes of all files.

## Commit

Use <git commit -m "write user friendly Message"> for commit your change.
Here -m is used for writing message.


git status --> for checking status
 * Tracked
 * UNtRACKED
